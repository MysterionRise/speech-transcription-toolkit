# Python API

```python
from speech_toolkit import Transcriber, transcribe

result = transcribe("talk.mp3", backend="faster-whisper", model="small")
print(result.text)        # result.segments has start, end and text for each segment
result.save("talk.srt")   # txt, srt, vtt or json, from the extension

transcriber = Transcriber(backend="faster-whisper", model="small")  # load once, reuse
for path in ["a.mp3", "b.mp3"]:
    transcriber.transcribe(path, language="en").save(f"{path}.vtt")
```

## Transcriber

`Transcriber(backend="whisper", model=None, *, device=None, diarize=False, hf_token=None)` loads the model once.
With `diarize=True` it also loads the pyannote pipeline, and does that first, so a missing package or token fails
before a large model download.

`transcriber.transcribe(audio, language=None, task="transcribe", *, ...)` transcribes one file. Keyword options:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | Names, terms or a sample sentence that guide spelling. |
| `vad` | Skip silence first. |
| `word_timestamps` | Add per-word timings. Defaults to on when diarizing, so the speaker can change mid-segment. |
| `num_speakers`, `min_speakers`, `max_speakers` | Speaker-count hints; need `diarize=True`. |
| `verbose` | Show the backend's progress on stderr. |

Options the backend doesn't support are skipped with a warning. `transcriber.supports("vad")` (or `"prompt"`,
`"word_timestamps"`) tells you in advance.

`transcribe(audio, backend=..., model=..., **options)` loads a model and transcribes one file in a single call. To
transcribe several files, create a `Transcriber` once instead.

The Hugging Face token, from `hf_token`, `HF_TOKEN` or `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`, is exported as `HF_TOKEN` for model downloads.

## Results

`TranscriptionResult` has:
- `text`: the full transcript.
- `segments`: dicts with `start`, `end` (seconds) and `text`.
  - With word timestamps on, each also has `words`: a list of `{"word", "start", "end"}` dicts.
  - Some backends add their own fields.
- `language`: the language code, detected or given.
- `speaker_segments`: with diarization, the segments with a `speaker` label each; otherwise `None`.
- `raw`: extra backend output, for example faster-whisper's `duration` and `language_probability`.
- `render(fmt="txt", max_line_width=None)`: the result as txt, srt, vtt or json text.
- `save(path, fmt=None, max_line_width=None)`: writes the rendered result, taking the format from the extension.

See [Output formats](formats.md) for what each format contains.

## Errors and warnings

The library raises exceptions and never exits:
- `ValueError` for bad arguments: an unknown backend or model, or speaker hints without `diarize=True`.
- `ImportError` when an optional package is missing; the message names the extra to install.
- `FileNotFoundError` or `RuntimeError` for audio or model problems.

Warnings, such as an option the backend doesn't support, go through Python's `warnings` module.

## Custom backends

Subclass `TranscriptionBackend`, implement `available_models()`, `load_model()` and `transcribe()`, then register it:

```python
from speech_toolkit import TranscriptionBackend, register_backend

class MyBackend(TranscriptionBackend):
    ...

register_backend("mine", MyBackend)
```

See [Adding a backend](backends.md#adding-a-backend) for the details.
